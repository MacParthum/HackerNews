## Hacker News Api Newsreader

This application is a newsreader that calls the Hackernews Api. This project was built using React (create-react-app as a base) and the technologies used were React (Custom Hooks), Styled Components, Axios, Memo and React of course!

## I Got This to Work Perfectly!
This app can use some work on the UI but it runs like greased lightning because of the infinite scroll and memo that allow it to pull 30 stories at a time as the user scrolls even though it calls 500 stories in upon the intitial request. It took me quite some time to get this to work flawlessly. It was rewarding to play around with the final result especially if you like tech and web developer realated stuff.
