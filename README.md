## Hacker News Api Newsreader

This application is a newsreader that calls the Hackernews Api. This project was built using React (create-react-app as a base) and the technologies used were React (Custom Hooks), Styled Components, Axios, Memo and React Testing Library. I'm hoping this application gives people
a better understanding of React. YouTube video tutorial can be viewed here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DLRJj1YjvQ

## I Got This to Work Perfectly!
This app can use some work on the UI but it runs pretty smoothly because of the infinite scroll and memo that allow it to pull 30 stories at a time even though it calls 500 in upon the intitial request.  Since it's React and only pulling 30 stories at a time as the user scrolls its lightning fast. It took me quite some time to get this to work flawlessly and quite rewarding to play around with the final result.  I may come back and add more to this in the future...
